Server-Side APIs Challenge: Weather Dashboard

This is a challenge involving the use of server-side APIs to create a weather dashboard. When the user searches for a city, they ashould be presented with current and future conditions for that city, and that city should be added to the search history. When the user views current weather conditions for that city, they should be presented with the city name, date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index. When the UV index is viewed, the user shoul dbe presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe. When the user views future weather conditions for that city, they should be presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity. When the user clicks on a city in the search history, they should be presented with current and future conditions for that city.
